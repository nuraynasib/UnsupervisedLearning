One of the methods of association rules is market basket analysis. This type of method is basically a ‘if’ and ‘then’ rule. Simply put, if the consumer has a product in a basket, this approach determines the other items which the customer is most likely to buy. For example, if customers buy a beer then they are likely (with a 90 percent probability) to buy a bag of crisps. Mining such rules is very important in sales branch. Businesses may take advantage of these by organizing the store or catalogs in a specific manner, considering which items are more likely to be purchased together, setting up promotional promotions to promote the selling of a particular product or making customized discounts.
